# **📊 Sleep Health & Lifestyle — EDA Project**

## **📘 Project Overview**
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Sleep Health & Lifestyle** dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
The dataset contains ~400 entries with rich lifestyle and health-related attributes such as **sleep duration, sleep quality, heart rate, stress level, daily steps, BMI, blood pressure, and sleep disorders**.

The primary objective of this project is to understand **how lifestyle habits influence sleep health**, and to uncover meaningful relationships, correlations, and hidden patterns that impact overall well-being.

This EDA builds a strong foundation for future **predictive modeling** and supports real-world decision-making related to **health analytics**.

## **📂 Dataset Features Breakdown**
The dataset contains the following key attributes:

- **Person ID** — Unique identifier  
- **Gender** — Male / Female  
- **Age** — Age in years  
- **Occupation** — Type of profession  
- **Sleep Duration** — Hours of sleep per day  
- **Quality of Sleep** — Self-rated (1–10)  
- **Physical Activity Level** — Minutes of exercise per day  
- **Stress Level** — Rating (1–10)  
- **BMI Category** — Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese  
- **Blood Pressure** — Systolic / Diastolic  
- **Heart Rate** — Resting bpm  
- **Daily Steps** — Steps taken per day  
- **Sleep Disorder** — None / Insomnia / Sleep Apnea  

This combination of demographic, lifestyle, and physiological variables makes the dataset ideal for **behavioral and health analytics**.

## **⚙️ How I Performed EDA (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Imported the dataset** using Pandas  
2. **Explored dataset structure** — shape, datatypes, info(), head(), tail()  
3. **Checked for missing values & duplicates** and handled them  
4. **Cleaned and standardized data** — categorical + numerical fields  
5. **Performed statistical analysis** using NumPy:  
   - Mean, Median, Mode  
   - Standard Deviation  
   - Distribution understanding  
6. **Explored relationships between variables**  
7. **Visualized insights** using Matplotlib & Seaborn:  
   - **Histograms** (Sleep Duration, Stress Level)  
   - **Boxplots** (Heart Rate vs. Sleep Disorder)  
   - **Countplots** (BMI Category, Occupation, Sleep Disorder)  
   - **Scatterplots** (Daily Steps vs. Sleep Quality)  
   - **Heatmap** (Correlation matrix)  
   - **Pairplot** (Overall multi-variable relationships)  
8. **Interpreted findings** by analyzing trends, patterns, and correlations

## **🔍 Key Insights Discovered**

- **Higher stress levels negatively impact sleep quality**.  
- Individuals with **higher physical activity levels** tend to have better sleep duration.  
- **Sleep disorders** are more common among people with **high stress or low activity levels**.  
- **Daily steps** show a positive relationship with **sleep quality**.  
- **BMI Category** influences heart rate and sleep duration patterns.  
- The **correlation heatmap** revealed strong relationships among **heart rate, stress level, BMI, and sleep quality**.

These insights provide a strong base for future **machine learning models** related to predicting or classifying sleep disorders.
